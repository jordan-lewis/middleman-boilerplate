    As the Chief Executive Officer and Director of the [NBN Co](www.nbnco.com.au), **Michael Quigley** has overall responsibility for fulfilling the Commonwealth's policy goal of building and operating a ubiquitous, high-speed broadband network across Australia to enable the future of online services and telecommunications.   
    He joined the organisation a few years after returning to Australia following his retirement from the French telecommunications giant, Alcatel. He started his 36 year career in Alcatel research and development, and progressively took on more senior executive positions including being President and Chief Executive Officer of Alcatel USA.
    In 2003, Michael became President of Alcatel's Fixed Communications Group in Paris, responsible for infrastructure products, including network switches and optical communications systems. In 2005, he was appointed Alcatel's President and Chief Operating Officer, overseeing 55,000 staff and operations in 130 countries.

    Back in 1993, fresh from university, **Michael Malone** founded Western Australia's first Internet Service Provider (ISP), [iiNet](http://www.iinet.net.au), in the garage of his family home. Since then Michael has led the rapid growth which has seen iiNet grow from its humble beginnings, into the second largest broadband DSL ISP in Australia.
    Michael remains passionately committed to the transformative benefits of the internet and still holds the founding belief that has driven iiNet for 17 years - that awesome customer service is good for business.
    At our March 2012 Focus Dinner, Michael shared some fascinating insights into the evolution of Australia's number two ISP and spoke candidly about the legal case against iiNet by the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft, in which iiNet was eventually absolved of any copyright infringement by its users.
